welcome

copy the file named 'easymlmodule.py' to your path where python is installed you need to find 'lib\site-packages' in directory and paste the file

paste 'easymlmodule.py' in site-packages

if you dont know installation directory of python 

you can find python installation path in system environment variables

you can search for system environment variables with cortana

now it is expected that you have already installed opencv & numpy
		if not then use following commands with command prompt to install them respectively:
			pip install opencv-python
			pip install numpy 

see example t.py in example folder to learn how to use this package

thats it

thanks
