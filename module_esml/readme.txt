welcome

to install this machine learning module
use command 
pip install esml-module-v1

now it is expected that you have already installed opencv & numpy
		if not then use following commands with command prompt to install them respectively:
			pip install opencv-python
			pip install numpy 

see example t.py in example folder to learn how to use this package

thats it

thanks
